# Travel-Story

A Full Stack Travel Story App using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This app allows users to sign up, log in, and create personal travel stories with features like image uploads, and adding travel date. Also implemented search functionality to find stories, filter by date range, and pin favorite stories to the top. Users can also edit or delete their stories.

The backend features secure JWT authentication, MongoDB for storing user data and travel stories, and APIs for adding, editing, deleting stories, and uploading images. 
Covered the entire development, from setting up the frontend and backend to integrating APIs and building the UI components.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
